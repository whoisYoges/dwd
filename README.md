Dmenu Wallpaper Downloader (Automate wallpaper downloading using dmenu)

- dwd is a bash script to download random wallpapers according to the user input and order
- downloads high quality wallpaper from [wallhaven](https://wallhaven.cc).
- saves all the pictures in $HOME/Pictures/Wallpapers/ directory.

### Dependencies
1. dmenu

## Installation and Usage
*note: dmenu should have been installed OR ELSE you can modify the script accordingly to use with rofi/fzf or  just in a terminal emulator*

1. Get dwd script in your linux machine and execute it.

2. search your desired genere/category of wallpaper.

3. select sorting option such as: date_added, relevance, random, views, favorites, toplist

4. get some random wallpapers related to the category in $HOME/Pictures/Wallpapers/

5. Check the wallpapers and delete those you don't like.
